### What is XD Wiki ?

XD Wiki is a wiki repository built and maintained by XD colleagues to document the latest and awesome stuff built by the folks at Perficient XD.

### How do I contribute to XD Wiki ?

The XD Wiki pages are created using [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) so there's no need to know HTML.

Firstly, you need to be a XD Colleague. If you are not, [click](http://www.perficient.com/About/Careers) here to apply for the next best job in the world. 

If you are a XD Colleague, send an email to harish @ harish.bhavanichikar@perficient.com to get access to this repository and then do a git clone by 
```

```
You can then push and pull to this repository. To get an understanding of the structure of this wiki, refer to the [home](http://xdwiki.github.io/#!index.md) page.
