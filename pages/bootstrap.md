Bootstrap
======================

## Summary

Bootstrap is a popular front end framework used by XD Colleagues on a large number of client projects, to develop responsive websites.

### Pros

Bootstrap provides in-built responsive classes, jquery plugins and html components to start off building beautiful responsive web applications. It is easy, fun to learn and quick to be implemented across various backend technologies.

### Cons

At times, one needs to tweak bootstrap's inbuilt classes and plugins which might take more time, than writing one on your own. Also, if you are not using all of bootstrap's features, then including the heavy css file on your projects might add a toll on the http requests.
