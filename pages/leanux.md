Lean UX
======================

## What Is Lean UX?

Lean UX is a set of principles that may be used to guide you to better, more desirable solutions for users. Itâ€™s not a process in which each tool is rigidly applied.

The Lean principles underlying Lean Startup apply to Lean UX in three ways. First, they help us remove waste from our UX design process. We move away from heavily documented handoffs to a process that created only the design artifacts we need to move the team's learning forward. Second, they drive us to harmonize our "system" of designers, developers, product managers, quality assurance engineers, marketing and others in transparent, cross-functional collaboration that brings non-designers into our design process. Last, and perhaps most important, is the mindset shift we gain from adopting a model based on experimentation. Instead of relying on a hero designer to divine the best solution from a single point of view, we use rapid experimentation and measurement to learn quickly how well (or not) our ideas meet our goals. In all of this, the designer's role begins to evolve toward design facilitation, and with that we take on a new set of responsibilities.

4. Problem-Focused Teams
5. Removing Waste
6. Small Batch Size
7. Continuous Discovery
8. GOOB (Getting Out Of The Building): The New User Centricity
9. Shared Understanding
10. Anti-Patterns: Rockstars, Gurus, and Ninjas
11. Externalizing Your Work
12. Making over Analysis
13. Learning over Growth
14. Permission to Fail
15. Getting Out of the Deliverables Business

1. Adoption by companies not used to the process
2. Adoption by people not used to the process
3. More communication is needed with stakeholders to keep them up to date
